Dolphin build by Bird with help from mister_person (Mac) and Kaloshade (Linux)
Github source: https://github.com/Birdthulu/Ishiiruka/tree/master

Default buffer is 4 (Can now be set in Dolphin.ini under the NetPlay settings. EX: BufferSize = 4)
SD cards up to 4gb
Up and down arrow in game control volume
Client side music off check box on netplay window (To make this default right click Brawl and go to properties then patches and check the music off box)
Open chat in game with T
PM runs on SI Read polling
Setting to show clock in game
PM shows frame time
Added true aspect ratio for PM (69:40)
Black frame insertion and burn in reduction (An external frame limiter is needed to make BFI work. Use your graphics card's vsync instead of dolphin's)
Option to enable/disable writing to sd/memory card when playing offline (In config->general)
Discord Rich Presence
Fixed Gecko Code downloading
Changed buffer behavior so player buffers follow the minimum buffer if player buffer wasn't changed
Lowered dolphin's internal volume for the cubeb audio backend so you don't destroy your ears above 20% volume
Dolphin logo can now be set with Dolphin.png, dolphin_logo.png and dolphin_logo@2x.png in the Sys\Resources
Added netplay button to the main bar to make joining easier (Image by fudgepop01)
Now when hosting a netplay lobby the code is automatically copied to your clipboard
Added option to stream GCC inputs to file. Found in controller settings. (Credit to Hyperflame. Check Input Display.txt for instructions on usage.)
Added ability to check the MD5 checksum of brawl save files in the netplay window
